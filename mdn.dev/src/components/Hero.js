        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org">MDN Web Docs</a> (formerly
        MDN) was first launched by Mozilla around 2005,
        and has grown from humble beginnings to being one of the most popular
        web development resources on the web today. It now boasts over 13
        million page views per month, a strong ecosystem of documentation and
        data, and a lively community of contributors. It is used every day by
        professional web developers to do their jobs, and by students to learn
        new skills.
