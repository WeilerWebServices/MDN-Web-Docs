        <h3>1. Purpose</h3>

        <div class="indent">
            <p>A primary goal of Mozilla's View Source is to be inclusive to the largest number of participants, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).</p>

            <p>This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our conference community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.</p>

            <p>We invite all those who participate in View Source to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>2. Encouraging and Recognizing Participation</h3>

        <div class="indent">
            <p>A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase meaningful collaboration by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our conference community.</p>

            <p>Intentional, positive action is essential to avoid replicating within our conference community the many forms of inequality that exist in greater society. For this reason, we outline in this Code of Conduct expected behavior as well as prohibited behavior.</p>

            <p>If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our conference community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, recognize them for their good work either personally or by letting conference organizers know.</p>

        <h3>5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior</h3>

        <div class="indent">
            <p>Unacceptable behavior from any conference community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.</p>

            <p>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.</p>

            <p>If a conference community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the conference community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).</p>
        </div>

        <h3>6. Reporting Guidelines</h3>

        <div class="indent">
            <p>If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify the conference conduct team as soon as possible by emailing <a href="mailto:viewsource-conduct@mozilla.com">viewsource-conduct@mozilla.com</a>.</p>

            <p>Additionally, conference organizers are available to help conference community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>7. Addressing Grievances</h3>

        <div class="indent">
            <p>If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the conference conduct team by email at <a href="mailto:viewsource-conduct@mozilla.com">viewsource-conduct@mozilla.com</a> with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>8. Scope</h3>

        <div class="indent">
            <p>We expect all conference community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all conference community venues – online and in-person – as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to conference community business.</p>

            <p>This Code of Conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of conference community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of conference community members.</p>
