                                <p>The openness and ubiquity of the web has given us the freedom to express ourselves, create and tinker. Now the web is expanding beyond the screen to VR, AR, Speech, and the Internet of Things. In the closing keynote, Sean White will discuss what signs we can look for to visualize where the web is going and what role can a developer play in the future of the open web.</p>
