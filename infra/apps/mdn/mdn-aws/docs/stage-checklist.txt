# Refreshing staging instance

The staging instance has separate services from the production instance. The
staging database is initialized from an anonymized production database
backup. This database persists between deployments, and is refreshed
infrequently.

*TODO:* Add instructions for refreshing the staging database.

# Manual Sanity Check

## Home page

Load https://developer.allizom.org/en-US

* [ ] Loads without errors
* [ ] Does not have banner "MDN is currently in read-only maintenance mode. Learn more."
* [ ] Has "Sign in" or "View Profile" at the top
* [ ] Has entries for the Hacks Blog

## Article page

Load https://developer.allizom.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML

* [ ] Loads without errors
* [ ] No Maintenance Mode banner
* [ ] Has "Sign in" or "View Profile" at the top

# Functional Tests

With a Kuma environment and Docker, [run the functional tests][]:

[run the functional tests]: https://kuma.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tests-ui.html#run-tests-locally-using-selenium-docker-images

```
BASE_URL=https://developer.allizom.org scripts/run_functional_tests.sh
```


This will run a selection of safe Selenium tests (no login, no page edits) with
Chrome and Firefox, running in Docker images. A failing test is automatically
re-run before calling it a failure. Test results are created, with screenshots,
tracebacks, and logs for failing tests, including xfail and rerun tests.

* [ ] Functional tests pass

# Headless Tests

Headless tests require a Python environment with the requirements in
``requirements/test.txt``. See [Setting up test virtual environment][].
Run the headless tests, which make safe HTTP requests (no POSTs, no logins):

[Setting up test virtual environment]: https://kuma.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tests-ui.html#setting-up-test-virtual-environment

```
pytest tests/headless --base-url https://developer.allizom.org
```

* [ ] Headless tests pass
