# webvr-tests
Simple tests for testing WebVR functionality. See [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVR_API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVR_API) for the latest on the documentation.

The tests are as follows:

* [basic-display-info](https://mdn.github.io/webvr-tests/basic-display-info/) — Demo that detects all VRDisplays connected to the computer and displays all their basic capabilities.
* [field-of-view-test](https://mdn.github.io/webvr-tests/field-of-view-test/) — Demo that detects the first VRDisplay connected to the computer and displays its field of view information.
* [stage-parameters-test](https://mdn.github.io/webvr-tests/stage-parameters-test/) — Demo that detects the first VRDisplay connected to the computer and displays its stage parameterss.
* [raw-webgl-example](https://mdn.github.io/webvr-tests/raw-webgl-example/) — A quick 'n' dirty example that shows the basics of how to use the WebVR API.
* [vr-controller-basic-info](https://mdn.github.io/webvr-tests/vr-controller-basic-info/) — Demo that detects and outputs information about VRDisplays and associated controllers connected to your computer.
* [raw-webgl-controller-example](https://mdn.github.io/webvr-tests/raw-webgl-controller-example/) — A quick 'n' dirty example that shows the basics of how to use the WebVR API along with the Gamepad API to control objects in 3D space.
* [aframe-demo](https://mdn.github.io/webvr-tests/aframe-demo/) — A simple WebVR demo that uses [Mozilla's A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) framework to create a scene.
